# Real_Estate_Clark_County_2023
Analysis of the real estate market in Clark County, NV

Introduction:
In the dynamic realm of real estate, data-driven insights are the cornerstone of informed decisions. This project delves deep into Clark County's real estate landscape, harnessing data from Zillow, household income statistics, and school ratings. Python, a powerful tool, played a pivotal role in data cleaning and creating a robust data model. Combined with Tableau for compelling visualization, the study aims to offer holistic insights beneficial to homebuyers, sellers, and investors.

Data Collection:
The project began by gathering diverse datasets: real estate data from Zillow, household income data, and school ratings. These datasets, raw and unstructured, underwent a meticulous cleaning process using Python. Python's versatility streamlined the data cleaning process, ensuring consistency and accuracy. Once cleaned, the datasets were integrated, creating a comprehensive dataset that incorporated property details, pricing, neighborhood income levels, and school performance.

Data Cleaning and Modeling with Python:
Python emerged as the backbone of this analysis, excelling in data cleaning and modeling. Through custom scripts and libraries, Python handled missing values, removed duplicates, and transformed raw data into a structured format. Python also played a pivotal role in creating a sophisticated data model, allowing for in-depth analysis of correlations between real estate data, income levels, and school ratings.


Data Visualization with Tableau:

With a structured dataset created through Python, Tableau was used to craft an interactive, insightful dashboard. Integrating real estate, income, and school data, this dashboards provided an immersive experience. Users could explore property features alongside income levels and school ratings, fostering a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics.

Users of the dashboard can slice and dice data based on property type, size, median household income and school proficiency rating to identify properties with the highest return on investment. Based on selected parameters, potential homebuyers can gain an understanding of the potential gross rental yield (GRY) of various zip codes and properties.

Conclusion:
This project exemplifies the symbiotic relationship between Python's analytical capabilities and Tableau's visualization prowess. By leveraging Python for data cleaning and modeling, and Tableau for visualization, this analysis equips prospective homebuyers, sellers, and investors with a wealth of insights. 

Future Steps:
Continued research could incorporate additional datasets, such as crime rates and transportation accessibility, for a more comprehensive analysis. Machine learning algorithms could also be explored for predictive modeling, offering forecasts on property value trends based on evolving socio-economic and educational factors.
